# Siamese-Neural-Networks-with-Triplet-Loss-and-SVM-Classifier-for-Human-Action-Recognition
The project presents a modular action recognition pipeline, combining Siamese Networks with Triplet Loss for embedding learning and a separate SVM classifier to evaluate performance, achieving satisfactory accuracy on an evaluated dataset.
